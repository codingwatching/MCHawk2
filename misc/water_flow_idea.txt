// In OnSetBlock
if (type == FLOWING_WATER) {
	neighbors = m_map->GetNeighbors(x, y, z);
	for (auto& block : neighbors) {
		// Ignore blocks above original block
		if (block->type == FLOWING_WATER) {
			// Change block to FLOWING_WATER
			// Repeat process on said block (recursion)
			// Stack exhaustion? Use a command queue instead?
		}

		// Change original block to STATIONARY_WATER
	}
}

// Recursion
// Stack exhaustion possible
// Possibly hang checking large amount of blocks


// Command queue
commandQueue->add(block, CheckWaterFlow);
// In command queue update() go through each command and execute
// Deletes command when done
// No system governing blocks, fast if put on a thread or only execute X amount at a time
// No recursion


// Physics system
// Keep track of all flowing water blocks
// Periodically go through list and check if neighbors need updating
// Delete from list if changes to stationary or if deleted
// Slow?


// Minecraft original way -- Neighbor triggers, same as recursive method? Can't remember.
